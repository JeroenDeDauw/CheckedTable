We have structured Data in our SOFISwiki and wanted to have search for that. But a fulltext search like the MWSearch wasn't accurate enough. SMW Querys with searchforms from Semantic Forms didn't have enough features and didn't provide enough usability. So we had to create our own Search Extension called [[SolrStore]].

We use a default Apache Solr with a 90% dynamic generated schema based on the Attributes from our Semantic Mediawiki. Our Extension provides a fulltext Search like the MWsearch and a &quot;Fieldbased Search&quot;. The Search forms for the &quot;Fieldbased Search&quot; can be defined in the LocalSettings.php, but maybe in a further release it could be possible to use Semantic Forms for that.

During my talk, I will present the Cicero argumentation tool. Cicero is implemented as an extension of the Semantic MediaWiki. Its purpose is to support structured discussions between the participants of complex, collaborative decision and design processes. An introduction into the idea and the use cases of the Cicero tool will be given. Furthermore, I will discuss why we decided to use Semantic MediaWiki as the basis for implementing Cicero.

The yearly overview talk covering all the exciting developments since last SMWCon in Europe, all the cool things being worked on, and our roadmap.
== Linked Answers for Smarter Cities ==

After two years of using SMW and winning at [http://nycbigapps.com NYCBigApps] ([http://2010.nycbigapps.com/submissions/1799-nyc-data-web NYCDataWeb] with [http://revelytix.com Revelytix] in 2011, and [[NYCFacets]] in 2012), Joel finally took the plunge and co-founded [http://ontodia.com Ontodia].

Ontodia's first offering is [http://pediacities.com pediacities] - a &quot;Smarter City&quot; platform for Linked Open Data.

It leverages the converging trends of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data Big], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data Open], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data Linked] Data and New Urbanism to create '''Linked Answers about Cities'''.

[[User:Joel_Natividad|Joel Natividad]] will introduce the platform, show the current status and discuss usage scenarios and collaboration opportunities with the SMW community.

The Semantic MediaWiki Suite are optional extensions which can be enabled on the Wikia platform. Currently more than 150 wikis have these extensions enabled and use them in various ways. Some wikis use Semantic MediaWiki as a better categorization method, others use it as a structured page builder. My short presentation will demonstrate how Semantic Mediawiki is used on Wikia wikis, what problems we have with them and how we handle the issues.

In this talk we introduce OntoWiki, an open-source tool that is developed at the AKSW research group in Leipzig. OntoWiki is a tool providing support for agile, distributed knowledge engineering scenarios. It facilitates the visual presentation of a knowledge base as an information map, with different views on instance data. It enables intuitive authoring of semantic content, with an inline editing mode for editing RDF content, similar to WYSIWIG for text documents. OntoWiki provides sophisticated means for navigating, visualizing and authoring of RDF-based Knowledge Bases. It serves and consumes Linked Data and comprises a comprehensive middleware API for building custom Semantic Web applications. OntoWiki uses RDF in the first place to represent information. For human users, OntoWiki allows to create different views on data, such as tabular representations or maps. For machine consumption it supports various RDF serializations as well as RDFa, Linked Data and SPARQL interfaces. Since its introduction in 2006, the application has evolved into a framework for building Semantic Web applications and was recently updated to support the collaboration across multiple domains and application via Semantic Pingback and RDFauthor.

The Information Workbench is a platform for Linked Data applications in the enterprise.  Targeting the full life-cycle of Linked Data applications, it facilitates the integration and processing of Linked Data following a Data-as-a-Service paradigm. 

In this talk we present how we use Semantic Wiki technologies in the Information Workbench for the development of user interfaces for interacting with the Linked Data. 
The user interface can be easily customized using a large set of widgets for data integration, interactive visualization, exploration and analytics, as well as the collaborative acquisition and authoring of Linked Data. The talk will feature a live demo illustrating an example application, a Conference Explorer integrating data about the SMWCon conference, publications and social media.

We will also present solutions and applications of the Information Workbench in a variety of other domains, including the Life Sciences and Data Center Management.

In this talk, we'll present a new extension to enhance the current &quot;Enhanced Retrieval&quot; functionality. This new SOLR based extension will enable users of SMW to carry out full-text search on all textual fields, relevance will be considered as an important factor for display results. The extension will index over rendered wiki pages (not the raw wiki pages). It will come with a parser function to display the search results as well as the UI inline (within a wiki page), rather than a special page. It also enhanced faceted browsing/search UI via richer data types.

In this talk we present our research project [http://www.dipf.de/en/projects/virtual-research-environment-for-research-in-the-history-of-education-smw-cora SMW-CorA] which is targeting researchers in the history of education and provides a virtual research environment to allow annotation and analysis of a large digitalized corpus of historical lexica. One result is the [[Semantic Image Annotator]] extension which allows to annotate rectangular image sections semantically. Moreover we present three major problems/challenges that we encountered, namely: 
# multilinguality of schemata and annotations, 
# continuous adjustment of schemata and annotations,
# levels of visibility of content and controlled RDF export.

We are here to present an application built on top of SMW to help crowd-source knowledge acquisition. This application is part of a bigger effort in [http://projecthalo.com Project Halo], and we expect it can lower the cost to obtain easy to encode high quality statements from more complex textbook sentences. The application employs AJAX to improve usability and productivity of users, it also takes advantage of structure of the textbook and semantic relationship to help achieve the goals. A prototype will be presented and demoed.

'''WikiVote! Foresight wiki''' is an installation of WikiVoteWiki platform that was used during the [http://www.foresighttrip.ru/eng/ Foresight trip] on August 13-19 from Moscow through the most beautiful Russian cities and back again. It will be also used as a platform for support a variety of foresight methodologies. The wiki uses the power of SMW to dynamically slice and dice the foresight data, it has custom design, semantically-enabled user profiles and flexible voting system. Moreover, some of the business logic were implemented with the help of inferencing and semantic queries.

==Terminology and problem domain==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foresight_(futures_studies) Foresighting] is the study of strategic planning the very distant future. Foresighting lays between planning and forecasting.
One of the main documents that people create during the foresight is the roadmap - graphicaly represented set of trends, possible events etc., their key characteristics (possible years of happening, probability, importance, etc) and the relationships between all of these entities. Foresight approach are now used in Europe, Russia and Japan for effective strategic planning.

== Who is using Foresight wiki ==
The wiki were deployed in the boat's intranet and were accessible by WiFi. There were about 300 participants that were engaged in creation of foresights. During the trip participants were having methodologically organized offline brainstorming sessions. Afterwards  they could think more deeply on the ideas born in the brainstorming and improve the foresight articles online.

After the trip the wiki was made accessible on the Web.
== Overview of Semantic MediaWiki usage ==
=== Data storage ===
In Foresight Trip Wiki we tried to use semantic properties for all sorts of data so that the wiki has a common data model. This enabled the possibility to use &lt;tt&gt;#ask&lt;/tt&gt;-queries for all sort of things. The semantic properties are used for the following data:
* foresight objects such as trends, future technologies, laws etc.
* user profiles,
* voting data,
* information about page authorship.

All the data is entered via Semantic Forms. We have developed several new Semantic Forms Inputs and merged them into SFI extension: 
* '''Two listboxes''' input as user-friendly alternative to existing inputs like checkboxes and select. Two listboxes allows users to enter a list of values and has all the functions of traditional select. 
* '''Spinbox''' input is a common way to enter numerical values in the desktop applications. We believe that the spinbox is more preferrable since it doesn't allow to enter non-numeric values and gives user unambiguous hint about the data type. 
* '''URL''' input is used for enter either names of the wiki pages or external URLs.
* '''Semantic Maps''' input was improved in two important aspects. Many of the users were confused by two separate inputs: the address box and the address finder on the map. We decided to both save the address and use the address box as a finder. The second improvement is that we've added Yandex maps support to Maps and Semantic Maps extensions. Yandex maps is very popular in former Soviet Union; it also has more detailed maps of Russian cities and villages.
=== Data representation ===
We have used &lt;tt&gt;#ask&lt;/tt&gt;-queries very intensively both on integration pages with summaries and infographics, but also in templates, skin and our own extensions. 

One of the greatest features of &lt;tt&gt;SMW-QL&lt;/tt&gt; language that is used in &lt;tt&gt;#ask&lt;/tt&gt;-queries is its immense flexibility. We've made the system for foresight creation before. Not long before the trip we suddenly realized that there will be a dozen or more foresight sessions organized on a trip! However after a short period of panic we found the way to organize the content with categories and make our summaries and statistics distinct from each other. For that we only needed to add Category restrictions in our queries and write a small extension to make [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Sidebar sidebar] navigation more pleasant and dynamic. 
=== Business logic ===
We've been already convinced that Semantic MediaWiki is an ideal choice if you want to create very dynamic websites. However we have tried to do more than many other SMW wikis namely we used SMW queries, parser functions and variables to implement parts of the logic of the system. 
&lt;div style=&quot;background-color:pink;&quot;&gt; TODO: ADD DESCRIPTIONS OF THE TRICKS WE USE&lt;/div&gt;

=== SMW data in custom extensions and skin ===
== Voting ==
Voting is the essential part of offline foresight sessions and much effort has been put to make voting system as good and flexible as possible. First we have used [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ArticleFeedback Article Feedback] which is really great extension from MediaWiki team. Since it was pretty easy to semantize the average votes the [http://code.google.com/p/semantic-article-feedback/ Semantic Article Feedback extension] was born. 

However efficient and well-designed Article Feedback could be, it was still not enough. Sometimes we needed just yes/no votes, sometimes we though about the 0..100 scale like in [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:W4G_Rating_Bar W4G_Rating_Bar], sometimes the customers needed several criteria of evaluation so the voting bar needed to look more like questionnaire. What was even more important is that different kinds of objects have to be handled differently in terms of voting and evaluation. After a while we decided to write our own voting extension that can support all the functions we need.

The newly-baked WikiVote Voting extension includes the following features: 
* the administrator can construct the voting bar for category or for namespace with any number of evaluation criteria,
* very flexible system of access control so that the administrator can define what groups of users can vote and what user will see the voting results,
* the system supports yes\no votes, slider scales (1..100, 0..5, etc), discrete scales (scales like &quot;very bad, bad, normal, good, very good&quot;)
* the average votes are already available in the semantic form so we can use the votes as a sorting criteria or create the visualizations and infographics that can neatly and nicely show the current situation. 
* support a variety of algorithms for voting and several strategies for dealing with user ratings (the weight of the user vote is depends of her computed expertise in this particular area of knowledge), plus some tricks for dealing with ever-changing nature of the wikipage
In the future projects we want to enable the users to vote for the sections of the text, make some visualizations related to the dynamics of the votes

== User management ==
Many wiki-engines don't care very much about the user data. MediaWiki provides the User page which unstructured (it's hard to use the data from this page) and requires to know wiki markup. This is clearly very careless approach since the wiki is always a social system.
First we tried [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SocialProfile Social Profile] extension to manage user data and created [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Semantic_Social_Profile Semantic Social Profile] to make its fields accessible to &lt;tt&gt;#ask&lt;/tt&gt;-queries. Before long we realized that Social Profile is not very flexible, have many important limitations and is written mostly to make your wiki look like social network. What's more important is that the profile's fields weren't typed so it was difficult to semantize them. We've been trying to improve Social Profile by adding access control to its field, making them restricted, improving its user interface but have eventually given up and started to find another solution. 

We found a great way to manage user profiles by using Semantic Signup and Semantic Forms. It was simple, it was elegant and it was semantic out-of-the-box. The only thing we miss about the old Social Profile is the access control: in the real world you need to be very careful with the user data
&lt;div class=&quot;details mw-collapsible mw-collapsed&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#F3F3F3; width:800px&quot;&gt;
'''Technical details on user privacy'''
&lt;div class=&quot;mw-collapsible-content&quot;&gt;
it's still theoretically possible to make some of the fields of the user profiles invisible. Yet before you can tell that the wiki users can store their credit card number you need to think about so many things: 
* don't show the user data in the normal, rendered mode,
* never show the wiki-markup,
* be sure that it never turns into semantic property, so it can never be visible with &lt;tt&gt;#ask&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;#show&lt;/tt&gt;, Special:Ask, SMW API and Factbox,
* restrict access via MediaWiki API,
* don't forget the &lt;tt&gt;printable&lt;/tt&gt;
* what about wiki diff? 
* hehe, and also &lt;tt&gt;?action=oldid&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;?action=history&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;Special:ExportRDF&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Special:Export&lt;/tt&gt;,
* probably much more.

When you think about making some fields of the Semantic Forms private to the users and administrators, the following quote comes inevitably to mind: 

:''The technology involved in making anything invisible is so infinitely complex that nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand million, nine hundred and ninety-nine million, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine times out of a billion it is much simpler and more effective just to take the thing away and do without it.''
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right; font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams Douglas Adams], Restaurant at the End of the Universe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
== Appearance ==

One of the goals of the creators was to make wiki look and feel very unlike Wikipedia but still make it easy for user to recognize that every article can be edited and voted for. 
This goal define Foresight Wiki design specificity: 
# it has custom skin with less buttons, toolboxes and settings 
# the user never sees the wiki markup: even the diff is visual
== History ==
The foresight methodology requires to always know which version of the object description had been discussed offline. Because of that we modified MediaWiki history and add so called milestones to it. 
&lt;div style=&quot;background-color:pink;&quot;&gt; TODO: ADD DESCRIPTION OF THE WIKIVOTE HISTORY&lt;/div&gt;

== Bots and cyborgs ==
There are several kinds of bots live on a Foresight wiki and doing repetitive tasks. I remind that the whole process has taken place on a boat trip where the wasn't much Internet access for 300 people. Because of that we wanted to create all the users beforehand using the information they gave during the registration. 

Since the offline brainstorming sessions were the essential part of the trip, we also needed to import the results of such sessions in the wiki. For this task we used special bot coupled with Excel template for foresight note taking, that restricted and validated the values entered in the spreadsheet. 

Cyborgs

== Wikidata: Semantic Wikipedia ==
A team of 12 is currently working on Wikidata at Wikimedia Deutschland. Their goal is to create the foundation for a knowledge base that can be accessed by the Wikipedias as well as 3rd parties. It will bring structured data to the Wikimedia projects and offer a community-maintained collection of facts and their sources to the world. One example: Wikidata contains the birthdate of a person of public interest associated with the person’s name. This can then be used in all Wikipedias (and outside of them) and only needs to be maintained in one place.

[[User:Denny_Vrandecic|Denny Vrandečić]] will introduce the project, show the current status and discuss possibilities for collaboration between SMW and Wikidata.

Many organisations use Excel for budgeting and expense planning and for comparing budgets and plans with financial outcomes. Great organisations use spreadsheets only for reports and presentations [http://dssresources.com/papers/features/castellina&amp;hatch/CFO_IXN_Shared%20Research_No2_Financial,%20Planning,%20Budgeting%20and%20Forecasting%20in%20the%20New%20Economy_Aberdeen,Mar%202011.pdf], whereas the actual data is stored in server-based systems. 

However, for users, those systems are mostly read-only. ETL processes regularly extract, preprocess, and load financial data into a data warehouse. Only interactive analyses can be performed and static reports  created, yet, discussions and documentation of actions are done offline, using office suites.

We will discuss how to use Semantic MediaWiki for a more agile approach of collaborative budgeting, expense planning, and analysis in a use case of finance management within a research group.

Expertise is recognized as an important asset for any organization. It can be defined as the extensive knowledge and abilities that persons possess in particular areas of study based on research, experience and occupation, which set them apart from other persons operating in these areas. It is generally accepted that knowledge can be divided in explicit and implicit knowledge. The former kind of knowledge includes the theoretical understanding of a subject (''knowing that'' knowledge), whereas the latter refers to practical skills (''knowing how'' knowledge). Expertise management is about capturing and disseminating the skills possessed by experts, that is, the know-how to perform activities for achieving goals.

Just as knowledge needs to be managed, the same applies for expertise. In this article, we will show how expertise can be managed, including explicit as well as implicit knowledge. Frequently, implicit (skill) knowledge is equated with tacit knowledge, that is, knowledge that is possessed by experts, but cannot be explained, and therefore cannot be managed. However, this is not true in general. Take for example learning how to drive a car. Clearly, driving a car cannot be learned from just an instruction book. Instead, a novice seeks help from an experienced instructor, who shows the good practices and also the pitfalls to avoid. At first, a novice needs all its attention to master the driving practices, but after a while, the practices become more and more internalized. Eventually, the practices can be executed without thinking consciously. The conclusion is that implicit (skill) knowledge can be transferred from the initiated to the uninitiated. However, further practice is needed to become a real expert. In practice this means that organizations can be turned into learning organizations by sharing explicit and to a certain extent implicit knowledge thereby accelerating the learning process of individuals.

The process of sharing knowledge is grounded in the [[wp:en:Soft_systems_methodology|Soft Systems Methodology]] (SSM). The result is an Expertise Management Method (EMM),  specifically addressing expertise management issues. It is beyond the scope of this article to go into more detail. Nevertheless, a few remarks are in order here. First of all, expertise need not only be shared, but need also be valuated. For instance, a seasoned employee leaving a company has gained expertise on particular subjects. The question is whether this expertise has value for the company or not. It might be the case that the expertise is outdated due to changing working methods. Generally speaking, this means that expertise must be valuated by peers. In essence, this is a group learning process, providing a way to turn an organization into a learning organization. Second, not only good practices need to be captured, but also bad practices. Learning form mistakes is essential to learning.

Once knowledge has been shared and valuated, the knowledge must be shaped in such a way that it can be disseminated. To this end, we have developed a brain-inspired expertise management ontology (EM&lt;sub&gt;ont&lt;/sub&gt;) that captures both explicit and implicit knowledge. EM&lt;sub&gt;ont&lt;/sub&gt; is based on the latest insights in the working of the human brain, stemming from diverse disciplines, including cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, computer science, and philosophy. In particular, the speculative, but for our purposes very useful, [[wp:en:Memory-prediction_framework|Memory Prediction Framework]] (MPF) is used to capture implicit (skill) knowledge. MPF states that we think about the (near) future, whether consciously or not, by making analogies with past experiences. In a way, we predict the future. Another source for EM&lt;sub&gt;ont&lt;/sub&gt; is situating knowledge in context and using the [[wp:en:Paul_Thagard|cognitive coherence theory]] within a context for finding solutions for given problems.

The overall architecture of EM&lt;sub&gt;ont&lt;/sub&gt; is based on a flexible building block approach with which the various insights can be tied together in a consistent way. EM&lt;sub&gt;ont&lt;/sub&gt; has been implemented in SMW. The combination of a wiki and a semantic database makes SMW a good vehicle for capturing and disseminating expertise.

In this hands-on tutorial about the [[Semantic MediaWiki Plus|SMW+]] we will demonstrate the additional features provided by SMW+.
* built-in WYSIWYG editor supporting semantic features
* Faceted Search
* interactive query formulation
* ontology browsing and editing
* automatic semantic forms
* refactoring the ontology
These features support an agile approach to Knowledge Management because the wiki users (think knowledge workers) get tools for managing their domain ontology and apply it in their knowledge creation processes.

We do not only demonstrate these features but you will also interactively use them for
* creating basic wiki articles
* formulating semantic annotations in wiki pages
* querying and visualizing data
* collaboratively creating the data model/ontology
* populating the ontology via automatically generated forms
So, bring your own laptop and work with SMW+ right during the conference.

A lot of improvements and additions have been made to [[mw:Extension:Maps|Maps]] and [[Semantic Maps]] over the last year. This talk aims to give you an overview of these new features as well as where and how you can use them. Yes, there will be demos :) It will also include a quick introduction to the extensions, some best practices and a few words on what awesome features people are currently working on. There will also be some time for questions.

Some of the topics that will be covered are:

* Displaying maps with the improved #display_map parser function.
* Polygons, lines, rectangles, circles and whatnot
* A graphical map editor
* Marker clustering and marker grouping
* Searching through markers
* Annotating and querying geospatial data

In my talk I will present the following tools:
* JOBAD - a JavaScript framework transforming semantic rich documents into Active Documents. Think of interactive services like: definition lookup, formulae expansion, unit conversion.
* LaTeXML Daemon - a highly efficient LaTeX -&gt; XHTML translation service that can handle semantic annotations in both text and formulae.
* MathSearch - the Lucene equivalent for formulae indexing and search.
* RedSyS - a framework allowing real-time integration of heavy and data-near semantic services (think of NLP services) into the editing process.

Current implementations are integrated in the drupal-based Planetary System but they could be adapted to run in SMW with little effort.

Like SMW, BlueSpice is extending MediaWiki with a lot of functionality. It is a set of extensions which is designed to facilitate the use in non encyclopaedic contexts such as enterprise environments. It is an all in one bundle that aims to cover for all the basic needs of a professional MediaWiki installation.

Among other things, BlueSpice includes a new skin with dynamic information and a flexible navigation concept. Also there is improved editing support with a WYSIWYG-editor and several assistants for linking various sources. There are some additional communication features like a blog and a shoutbox. Interaction among authors is encouraged by displaying pictures of the authors of each article. Search has been enriched with a facetted search feature. For site maintainers, there is a centralized administration page for users.

Semantic functionality is an increasing demand for our users and we do maintain several installations running BlueSpice and Semantic MediaWiki. There are some challenges, though, to a deeper integration of both systems, among them duplication of functionality, a very different code base and different approaches to user interface design. So I'd like to reach out and discuss ways of tackling these issues to the benefit of both systems.

In my opinion, one of the most pressing questions for both communities will be the compatibility and versioning politics of MediaWiki itself. In the MediaWiki world, development is mainly focussed on Wikipedia deployment. One result is the quarterly release cycle, which puts some adoption pressure on BlueSpice and Semantic MediaWiki. I'd like to discuss how SMW and BlueSpice each cope with the issue and maybe even, what we can do to make things easier for us and other third parties.

In this presentation I will focus on the idea to use some new markup introduced by the [[Semantic Expressiveness]] (''SemEx'') extension to short-query semantic data rather than having authors maintaining redundant pieces of text within articles. This will also explore related problems and introduce some best practice and other important aspects on how this feature can be used in a flexible way throughout the Wiki. The [http://rpg-dev.org RPG-Dev-Wiki system] for which the extension was originally developed for will serve some examples on how this can be used.

Besides presenting current ''SemEx'' features and best practice, I will also give an overview over future plans and problems in the extensions development and would like to encourage to discuss some of the extensions ideas.

The Dutch government has a 'family' of reference architectures. The Dutch Government Reference Architecture 'NORA' is the mother of several domain-specific e-government reference architectures, e.g. GEMMA for municipalities, PETRA for provinces, WILMA for water control authorities, ROSA for the education sector, etc. Each reference architecture falls under a different authority, but there is obviously a connection between them.

For the past few years, we have been working (together with several ministries and other government organizations) on annotating and disseminating the reference architectures in semantic wiki's. Together with the ministry of education and the ministry of internal affairs we are currently establishing cross-wiki links so that the knowledge in the NORA-wiki can be linked to, and reused in, the ROSA-wiki. When the NORA evolves, architects of the ROSA can view the changes in a Dashboard that is placed in the wiki. The idea is that all other NORA 'daughters' will use the same techniques so that they get timely updates in their own wiki on the evolution of the NORA, while at the same time the way in which NORA is applied in the different domains can be monitored from within the NORA wiki via interwiki-queries.

This short talk shows how to customise the MediaWiki page actions based on semantic data stored by SMW.

== Example: Download URL ==

As an example, we want to create a &quot;Download&quot; tab that links to the value of the property [[Property:Download URL|Download URL]], if such a value exists.

'''Warning: the example takes user input from wiki pages to create HTML interface elements. It will thus allow any user who can edit a page to add such elements to the UI.''' In our case, users are enabled to link to an arbitrary page, which could be unsafe in public wikis (used to trick other users into clicking something). In general, user input '''must be escaped or sanitised''' before being used in HTML, or otherwise this could be used to compromise the website. URLs are sanitized, so the risk there is only to link to undesired pages.

The following steps are enough to realise this little example:
* Create the property [[Property:Download URL|Download URL]] and set its type to &quot;URL&quot;
* Insert the following at the end of LocalSettings.php:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;php&quot; enclose=&quot;div&quot;&gt;
$wgHooks['SkinTemplateNavigation'][] = function ( SkinTemplate &amp;$sktemplate, array &amp;$links ) { 
	global $wgTitle; // this should be the title of our current page

	if ( is_null( $wgTitle ) ) {
		return true; // but let's be prepared for strange things
	}

	// Create an SMW object for the subject page ...
	$subjectDi = SMWDIWikiPage::newFromTitle( $wgTitle );

	// ... and for the property that we care about (note the _)
	$propertyDi = new SMWDIProperty( 'Download_URL' );

	// Find all values that this page has for this property:
	$propValues = smwfGetStore()-&gt;getPropertyValues( $subjectDi, $propertyDi );

	// if there are results at all
	if ( !empty( $propValues ) ) {
		// take the first one
		$valueDi = reset( $propValues );

		// check that it is really a URL
		if ( $valueDi instanceof SMWDIURI ) {
			// get the URI
			$url = $valueDi-&gt;getURI();

			// Modify the MediaWiki actions to show this URL
			// Use 'views' instead of 'namespaces' to get the tab on the right (in Vector)
			$links['namespaces']['mytest'] =
				array(
					'class' =&gt; '', 
					'text' =&gt; 'Download',
					'href' =&gt; $url
				);
		}
	}

	return true; // always return true in a hook
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This code works at least under MediaWiki 1.17 up to 1.21 using SMW 1.7 or 1.8. 

While enabled on this wiki, this feature can be demoed on the page [[SMWCon Fall 2012/Semantic MediaWiki: An Introduction]].

== Performance considerations ==

The above code will be executed on many page views, even if the page is not edited. This is no concern for small and medium sites, but one should still keep this in mind when doing similar extensions. If you are using an HTTP cache (Squid, Varnish) then the page HTML will be cached and no code will be executed if it is available from the cache. But the normal MediaWiki parser cache does probably not cache the page actions, so it will not prevent the code to be run on page views.

Over the last year (2012) development work has started on the [[Help:Filtered format|Filtered format]] with the aim to finally replace the [[Help:Exhibit format|Exhibit format]].

Today two views and two filters are available:
* list view
* calendar view (nearly there)
* values filter
* distance filter

The result format aims to be:
* modular and easily extendable
* well skinnable
* tightly integrated with SMW

A lot of work still needs to be done:
* debugging and improving the framework
* more views
* more filters

The work on this format was initiated and sponsored by [http://www.prescientsoftware.co.uk Prescient Software].

[http://toneelstof.be Toneelstof.be] is a website showcasing 4 decades of theater history in Flanders, Belgium.

The website's [http://toneelstof.be/w editors interface (or backend)] is Semantic Media Wiki, and the front end of the website uses Javascript and SVG, using the libraries [http://code.google.com/p/rdfquery/ rdfquery] for JS-based RDF access, and [http://d3js.org/ d3.js] (in particular the [https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Force-Layout force layout]) for graphical layout, to create a dynamic timeline of linked data. PHP &amp; Python are used to dump RDF data from the SMW and then join it with additional information coming from the central database of the VTI (which has information such as specific seasons a given production took place). Search (in the frontend) is handled via the standard Mediawiki API.

The site is a production of the [http://vti.be/ Flemish Institute for the Performing Arts] and was designed by [http://automatist.org Michael Murtaugh] and [http://snelting.domainepublic.net/ Femke Snelting].

The general idea for this session will be two-fold:

1- Give you a walk-through of setting up a sandbox Semantic MediaWiki site from scratch, including importing a real data set provided by Ontodia for the occasion. This section will be illustrated with slides to save time and leave more room for actual experimentation.

2- Give you a chance to extend the sandbox site by answering challenges or building on your own ideas.

The sandbox site is up already: http://bit.ly/smwconnyc

Feel free to take a look at the data, the challenges and start thinking about what you would like to do with it.

Let me know in advance if you would like to use a particular extension. Here is what is available on the site so far : [http://ec2-23-23-51-25.compute-1.amazonaws.com/mediawiki/index.php/Special:Version Special:Version]

==SMW+ Architecture==
*Goals still valid
**Boost Web 3.0 
**Help open software
**Promote S/MW 
*''Create baseline semantic tools for:'' search, ingestion, storage, annotation, gardening (bots), vocabularies &amp; ontologies
*''Create baseline tools for Mediawiki:'' installation, security, script manager, rich media
*Excellent process (Forums, Use-it-yourself wiki, unit testing, great user help/info)
*But
**Patched MW/SF code
**No documentation now
**Community support only
===SMW+ Extensions===
*Semantic extensions
**Enhanced Retrieval
**Halo ACL
**Rich media
**Rule knowledge
**Semantic comments
**Semantic gardening
**Semantic refactoring
**Semantic treeview
**Semantic result formats+
**SMW Halo
*Utility extensions
**ARC-2 library
**Automatic semantic forms
**Data import
**Script manager
**Triple store connector
**Wiki administration tool
**Wiki object model
**WYSIWYG (FCKEditor)
==SMW+ Extensions Roadmap==
*''SMW+ Roadmap consists of two efforts:'' 
**Deploy (not all) SMW+ extensions on MW 1.19+ 
**Re-create user-level information
*Extension re-deployment
**''Key SMW+ Extensions:'' Enhanced Retrieval &amp; Rich Media,  Access Control List, Semantic Treeview, Collaboration, SMW Halo (Query Interface &amp; Data Explorer); TSC (#sparql:) &amp; Data Import
**''Extensions to scavenge:'' Wiki Admin Tool (data model), WYSIWYG (annotation widget), Ontoprise Skin (menu), Script Manager, SMW Halo (Data Explorer, Query Interface), SRF+ (Simile interface)
**'''Extensions that are or seem to be &quot;quick wins&quot;:'' ARC2, ASF, WOM, Collaboration, Data Import, Semantic Gardening &amp; Treeview

Extensions that need FUNDING &amp;/or technical help: Halo ACL, Enhanced Retrieval, Rich Media, SRF+, WYSIWYG
==Future discussions==
*SMW+ namespaces = Type:page-name (A '''Type namespace''' may best identify which of 5 different representations possible in SMW wikis, apply to instances)
*Deploy tools need annotated mw:Extension pages (put SMW on mediawiki.org?) &amp; handle semantic 'bundles'
*Lucene/SOLR = SMW store plus SPARQL endpoint plus document parser (enhance SMW syntax for SOLR cores)
*Wiki security policies are not an issue, database policies are: need is clear for security-oriented exits in MW code

At Reed Elsevier Technology Services, we've built a repository for our enterprise technology artifacts using SMW technology.  We've done some novel work using semantic properties to manage the forward &amp; reverse relationships between the artifacts, including development of a graphical &quot;Knowledge Map&quot;.

Defining and managing complex software and server systems is an ongoing part of the modern &quot;devops&quot; approach. We'll present a Semantic Mediawiki-centered system that uses Nagios' NRPE and behaviour level tests to define and validate systems using overlaid widgets and a nodejs backend.

[[User:David Mason]] and [[User:Bill Doran]] are systems developers at the Concordia University's Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics, and the human rights organization Equalit.ie.

About upper-level undergrad philosophy courses using SMW to provide students with collaboration opportunities, resources, self-directed learning. Demo of the site &amp; coursework - browse the site at http://smw-kbt-demo.referata.com.

This talk will likely be more about you helping me, than me informing you.  :-)  (I'll be hoping for lots of feedback &amp; suggestions to improve my stuff!)

I'm a relatively inexperienced coder (I really know very little) and I stumbled on SMW as a way to coordinate my classes.  Specifically, I was looking for a way to manage 35 students all doing their own projects, without going mad.  This seems like a pretty miniscule use of SMW compared to these big data wikis on display, but this usage (I think) is profound in that it allows students to take control of their learning without being left to themselves.  I'll show you how I use SMW to structure the course, what it allows me to do that I couldn't otherwise - and what I'm hoping I'll be able to get it to do in the future.

A lot of improvements and additions have been made to [[mw:Extension:Maps|Maps]] and [[Semantic Maps]] over the last year. This talk aims to give you an overview of these new features as well as where and how you can use them. Yes, there will be demos :) It will also include a quick introduction to the extensions, some best practices and a few words on what awesome features people are currently working on. There will also be some time for questions.

Some of the topics that will be covered are:

* Displaying maps with the improved #display_map parser function.
* Polygons, lines, rectangles, circles and whatnot
* A graphical map editor
* Marker clustering and marker grouping
* Searching through markers
* Annotating and querying geospatial data

''[http://www.semanticsoftware.info/first-open-source-release-semantic-assistants-wiki-nlp Wiki-NLP Integration]'' is the first comprehensive open source solution for bringing Natural Language Processing (NLP) to wiki users, in particular for wikis based on the well-known MediaWiki engine and its Semantic MediaWiki (SMW) extension. It can run any NLP pipeline deployed in the [http://www.gate.ac.uk General Architecture for Text Engineering] (GATE), brokered as web services through the [http://www.semanticassistants.com Semantic Assistants] server. This allows you to bring novel text mining assistants to wiki users, e.g., for automatically structuring wiki pages, answering questions in natural language, quality assurance, entity detection, summarization, among others. The results of the NLP analysis are written back to the wiki, allowing humans and AI to work collaboratively on wiki content. Additionally, semantic markup understood by the SMW extension can be automatically generated from NLP output, providing semantic search and query functionalities.

In my presentation I will explain the Wiki-NLP Integration architecture and how NLP capabilities can be integrated within a given wiki environment. As application scenarios, I will demonstrate two applications based on our Wiki-NLP Integration that is used in real-world projects, one from the Software Engineering and one from the Biomedical domain.

Slides of the presentation can be found in [http://www.semanticsoftware.info/system/files/smwcon13_talk.pdf this link]. For more information, please visit our website on the [http://www.semanticsoftware.info/first-open-source-release-semantic-assistants-wiki-nlp Wiki-NLP project].

'''[http://www.cef-cfr.ca/uploads/Membres/PierreRacine-SMWCon2013-BeyondPoints.pdf Beyond points - How to turn SMW into a complete Geographic Information System]'''

SMW is a database. It is now possible to store complex geographic information – points, lines, and polygons – as a special GEOMETRY type in most other database systems. This talk will present why it is important to have a more complex geographical type than “Geographic coordinate” in SMW, what additions are needed to turn SMW it into a complete geospatial database and some clues on ways to implement them.

|Title=Developing professional standards with SMW
|Description=A professional standard is a document that describes the skills and responsibilities relating to a professional's position. In this talk we describe how a community can collaboratively write a professional standard using Semantic MediaWiki.

'''Standards of professional activity''' are documents that describe skills, knowledge and responsibilities relating to a professional's position. They are used in many areas and for many purposes: for hiring, creating curriculums at universities, certification programs, etc. 

Previously the standards were made by a small group of experts offline. Back then they sent the text of the standard to the professional communities for approval. Obviously this way the process was very slow and there were not many opportunities for professional communities to have an influence on how the standard should look like. Thus we have proposed a new, more crowdsourcing-like way of editing professional standards that relies on Semantic MediaWiki's great ability to structure the data involved.

In the talk I will describe: 
# how professional standards are structured and what methodology is used to write them
# how to organize the community for efficient standard editing 
# how semantic extensions helped us to implement the structure of the standard
# how we've used ranking and voting to support the process of editing

== How the data is organized ==
=== Working functions ===
[[File:Working function.png|300px]]

The standard consist of dozens of working functions. Working function consists of: 
* actions that the worker need to do, e.g. &lt;code&gt;fixing the cars&lt;/code&gt;
* knowledge and background that the worker needs to do the actions, e.g. &lt;code&gt;know how the car engine and breaks are organized&lt;/code&gt;
* skills that the worker needs to do the actions, e.g. &lt;code&gt;how to use use a screwdriver and a wrench&lt;/code&gt;
* professionally important qualities for this type of job, e.g. &lt;code&gt;accuracy, attention to the details&lt;/code&gt;

=== Classification of working functions ===
Working functions are organized in two-dimensional structure. The first dimension is qualification level, and the second dimension is activity category of the function. 

[[File:Opopop.png|what is working function|500px]]

The more qualification level is - the more responsibility the worker has and the higher position he can occupy in organization. For example '''4th level Manager'''  is responsible for 'here and now operations' and can be a boss of relatively small number of employees. The possible position for 4th level Manager in software company is team leader. In building he can be called foreman or brigade leader.
== Features ==
=== How Semantic MediaWiki have been used ===
It was hard to represent the matrix structure in SMW and at the same time untie the working functions from the classification framework. With the help of &lt;code&gt;format=template&lt;/code&gt; we managed to create the following table: 

[[File:Matrix_profstandad.png|the matrix of profstand|600px]]

Every row in this table is a category of work that a worker performs. Every column is a level of the worker. The intersections are the candidates for working functions described above. 

For the project we've used subobjects quite extensively. It had its benefits but the queries became very complex. 

Nevertheless the structure of the project is quite good and allows modifictions. Here [[Page Schemas]] were very useful: they allow you to generate the templates, forms and properties automatically and change them easily. In fact we were so excited about Page Schemas that even create a screencast on them: 

{{#widget:YouTube|id=R3VNRvt4G6w}}

=== Voting ===

We've developed the voting tool that allows users to collaboratively decide what the worker should and shouldn't do. Each cell of a table is clickable and shows the list of candidates for the working functions

[[File:standard wikivote voting.png|500px]]

=== Rating ===

In addition to voting we've developed the tools for users feedback. We've create a tool that allows users to rate the articles on various criteria. First we've used [[mw:Extension:Article Feedback]] extensions developed by Wikimedia foundation: 

[[File:ArticleFeedback.jpg]]

But we've soon discoved that Article Feedback is not nearly as powerful as we need. So we've created the new rating tool that allow administrator to create various kins of rating criteria for different categories. The results of the ratings are accessible with semantic queries and that allows us to use them for sorting. 

[[File:WikiVote rating.png|500px]]

=== Microsoft word document generation ===

We've developed the extension that generated &lt;tt&gt;*.docx&lt;/tt&gt; file with final version of the standard. The extension queries all working functions and chooses the leaders of the rankings.

== Use case: the professinal standard of a manager ==

The pilot project was to develop the professional standard of the manager. Part of the development process have been done offline, only 30% of working functions have been proposed online in the wiki. 
== Lessons learned ==

During the project we've learnt how important it is to figure out the processes of article editing, ranking and voting. The developed system have shown its usefullness but became too heavy and we're now in process of cutting off the features.</text>

This is the template for using with the conference Talks. Please describe your talks using this template so it could be included to our Hall of Fame in [[SMWCon]]. There are already [http://semantic-mediawiki.org/w/index.php?title=Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Talk&amp;hidelinks=1&amp;hideredirs=1 several dozens of pages that use this template], please look at them and use them as your examples. 

The template has the following fields: 
* '''Conference''' - type the name of the conference for example &lt;tt&gt;SMWCon Fall 2013&lt;/tt&gt;.
* '''Title''' - the full title of your talk, e.g. &lt;tt&gt;Using SMW for sharing lolcats&lt;/tt&gt;.
* '''Description''' - put in the abstract of your talk, 3-5 sentences long.
* '''Duration''' - how long do want to talk? For example &lt;tt&gt;30 minutes&lt;/tt&gt;
* '''Audience''' - who is your target audience? It can be &lt;tt&gt;Everyone&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Developers&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Community&lt;/tt&gt; and more (for full list of possible values see [[:Property:Has_audience_type]] )
* '''Type''' - possible values are &lt;tt&gt;Regular talk&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Tutorial&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Demo&lt;/tt&gt; and the others listed in [[:Property:Has_talk_type]]
* '''Speakers''' - list the speakers separated by comma. Each speaker should have her user page in &lt;tt&gt;User&lt;/tt&gt; namespace. For example: &lt;tt&gt;Yury Katkov&lt;/tt&gt;
* '''Slides''' - if you upload the slides to our wiki, put in the filename. Alternatively use '''Slides external''' and point to the slideshare. 
* '''Keywords''' - put in the keywords (tags) separated by comma for example &lt;tt&gt;cats, foresights, science&lt;/tt&gt;

'''Note''': ''We are unable to to present due to a lack of funding for travel. We attempted to have our employer cover the hotel and food and asked the Wikimedia organization for support with travel costs. The latter request was not funded.'' 

At Mercy, a medium-sized healthcare system based in the mid-west United States, we are leveraging Semantic MediaWiki to help organize documentation and definitions around the various metrics, statistics and measures that we track across our clinical work. These measures are for performance, government programs, payment programs, and award programs. I'd like to share what we've built using SMW, describe some of the use-cases and internal business partnerships we've discovered and hopefully provide some encouragement for using SMW in a large complicated organization.</text>

A wiki can be set up for various purposes one of them is technical writing and documentation. In technical writing there are established methods to guarantee consistent quality of documentation. Structured authoring is widely regarded as best practice.

Semantic features of SMW are very helpful for structured authoring and accessing structured content. We want to give a short introduction to the concepts of structured authoring and typical features of content management systems for technical writers. Then we would like to illustrate how some of these concepts can be realized in SMW and discuss how SMW may improve the experience of SMW users in the context of technical documentation.

We use SMW for intranet documentation platforms. Forms and templates help authors to create structured content and allow easy access to information. Annotating pages and querying properties create functionality that resembles features of content management tools for technical writers.

==Requirements in technical writing==
===What is good content?===
Good content is the center point of technical writing. It has to be correct and usable. Without it customers can’t use the full potential of a product, developers have a hard time to use an API that someone else developed, and service technicians might risk their lives installing a new power inverter for solar panels. In this talk we would like to look at the following indicators for content quality.
*Relevant content
**Stuff that matters to the user (solving problems)
**User- and task-oriented content
*Accessible content 
**Functional groups of content easy to identify 
***Reader must see immediately whether the topic is a procedure (I need to do something), a concept explaining technical background or referencing information, e.g. a list of parameters)
**Must suit different types of readers
*Up-to-date content
**Highlight status of content (draft, released, new version)

===What factors influence quality of content?===
When it comes to improve or sustain quality of content several factors come to mind. For our talk we would like to group them into two categories:
*Tool-independent factors
**User group analysis
**Minimalistic writing
*Tool-dependent factors
**Allow authors to focus on content quality (reduce unnecessary workload)
**Allow multiple ways to access information
The talk is going to focus on the tool-dependent factor and its underlying methods.

==Technical writing tools and methods==
===How conventional tools reduce workload of authors===
In technical writing, established methods and tools support the author in producing consistent content of reasonable quality. Structured authoring is considered to be state of the art. It is XML-based and relies on information models that are customized according to the needs of the domain. Popular XML document type definitions used in technical writing are DocBook and DITA. We are going to talk about our experience with DITA in SMW. 
The following list describes in short how DITA can be used in technical writing and how some conventional tools use it:
*Separate content from layout
**Structured authoring with XML foundation
*Help to organize content by classifying it (DITA)
**Acts as scaffolding to support author who’s is writing the topics and assembling topics into documents (information products) 
*Allow to check terminology and phrasing 
**Terminology management and authoring tools
*Allow reuse of content
**Reference content multiple times in same document (e.g. conref in DITA)
**Reuse topics for different documents
**Some tools even support building information products by drag-and-drop of content snippets
*Allow to manage variants of content 
**E.g. author does not have to maintain several  topics that only differ in name of product
**Conditional text allows filtering of content (maps with ditaval in DITA) 
*Allow single-source publishing
**Allow to publish content from one source to multiple formats (PDF, webhelp, HTML)
*Support workflow 
**Review and discussion of changes
**Release of content
*Allow to manage and publish different versions of content
**E.g. maintain different branches of documentation
*Allow users to comment and contribute to documentation
**Some CMS support review workflow with comments

===How conventional tools make content accessible===
Accessibility of content takes the user’s point of view into account. SMW as a wiki is authoring tool and published information product in one. This separates it from most other tools used in technical writing and opens up new possibilities. Technical writing usually produces different output formats. The format of the output heavily impacts how content can be accessed by the user. Accessibility also depends on the type of user. 
*Different types of users access content in different ways
**Tony CoverToCover-ReadsItAll
**Lindsey HyperTextBrowse
**John FullTextSearchy
*Ways of access (examples)
**Navigation functions – where am I, which topics are related
**Finding content by keywords (tag), full-text search, or hierarchical table of contents
**Invoke documentation from software user interface in order to directly get help for the window that the user is in
*Accessibility influenced by publishing target 
**HTML-based help with FTS, dynamic table of contents, index, hyperlinks, breadcrumb navigation, keyword tags…
**Printed document with table of content, header and footer, cross-references, index… 
**PDF with mixture of both

==SMW in technical writing==
===What’s possible in SMW?===
We are going to show some examples how we tried to model the aforementioned aspects in SMW and discuss our experience.  
The following list describes how the author was supported:
*Forms and templates allow to separate content and layout
**Still some knowledge of wiki syntax required
**Depending on wiki version support of editors in semantic forms is lacking
*Forms allow classification and harmonized structure of content
**E.g. each procedure requires description of goal and list of prerequisites
**Requires excessive use of free-text properties though
*Queries of properties allow to maintain content in one place and reuse
**Content is up-to-date and maintenance reduced
**E.g. feasible for data sheets of products
*Reuse of longer content can be done by transclusion and templates
**How do you maintain and organize hundreds of content snippets?

Accessibility was improved as follows:
*Properties model relation of information 
**Navigation and relations of content is building itself (browse sequence, hierarchy, table of  content, breadcrumbs navigation …)
**Also related link lists can be generated
*Content is tagged with keywords
**DITA information types can be browsed by Semantic Drilldown
**E.g show me all procedures that cover a certain subject then list all related reference information
*Properties were used to model workflow and status of document
**In the wiki content is available while people still work on it
**User has to see at first glance if content is draft or released
**Properties influence rendering of page

===Open issues?===
There are of course open issues when setting up and using SMW for technical writing. The following list contains some of them:
*Versioning is only feasible for single pages. But in technical writing clusters of content are versioned. How do you branch of an API documentation when a new version of the software is released?
*The mechanism to reuse content is there but there is no easy way to manage snippets of content if a certain number is exceeded. It is not uncommon in technical writing to manage hundreds of self-contained topics that are reused in several information products/manuals.
*Managing variations in content without duplicating huge parts of that content is possible but it makes reuse even more complex.
*Usability can be hard for authors not used to wiki syntax
**Editor support in forms is lacking
**Template picker for standardized text would be nice (e.g warnings according to ANSI) 
*Terminology management is possible but requires extensions that were not designed for that (Glossary with forbidden terms)</text>

We have been using Semantic MediaWiki for customer and contact management during the past 12 months, continuously testing new ideas and configurations. This talk is about the lessons learnt on our way to a &quot;Semantic CRM&quot;. We will look at typical functional requirements that business users have and how we have been trying to fulfill them in Semantic MediaWiki. We will show the potential that the system has as well as the challenges that will have to be overcome.
 

Before we started to consider Semantic MediaWiki as a &quot;lean&quot; CRM system, we had worked with several commercial and OpenSource CRM systems, from CRM@SAP to Salesforce.com to VTiger CRM. While all these systems have great features for various use cases, we found that Semantic CRM can be a real option for many companies. Several considerations speak in favour of Semantic CRM:

* Technology. We think, Semantic technology will allow use cases in the context of Customer Relationship Management that cannot be easily realized with other technologies, e.g.
** incorporating predictive functionality.
** running semantic analyses of free text content.
** creating complex queries.

* Flexibility. While we found it difficult to incorporate external content and systems with traditional CRM systems, Semantic MediaWiki allows the integration of various types of external content with comparatively little effort.

* Cost. Like other OpenSource systems, Semantic CRM has a clear cost advantage as compared with commercial CRM systems. This is nothing surprising but definitely one of the key decision drivers especially for SMBs.

* Ownership. For us and for many companies with whom we have discussed the idea of a Semantic CRM, the fact that the source code is not owned by a single commercial provider has been named a significant advantage of Semantic CRM.

 
Our technology clients are typically medium-sized companies across various industries. Most of them have started using Semantic MediaWiki for Quality Management and Documentation. Having seen the advantages of Semantic MediaWiki, they are now considering whether other use cases such as CRM could be realized with Semantic MediaWiki as well. Being companies and professional organizations, our clients want to make sure specific requirements are fulfilled before they use Semantic MediaWiki or any other OpenSource system:

* Support needs to be available at professional standards.

* No proprietary software modules are used; all parts of the solution need to be as close to the generally accepted standard as possible.

* A large community of developers needs to be available - and thereby a large choice of alternative vendors who could potentially take over service and support of the OpenSource software. 

 
Of course, Semantic MediaWiki is not a CRM system and some functionality that is provided by other systems is missing. We have been using semantic:apps, a Semantic MediaWiki adoption by gesinn.it, for several months now and gesinn.it is still incorporating new functionalities on an on-going basis. We are currently using the system mainly for

* Contact Management: Here, we manage organizations, contacts and relationships between contacts, organizations, projects and issues.

* Relationship History: We are using the system to create a 360 degree contact history, including sales calls, technical support requests and any other activities which are directly or indirectly related to a contact, organization, project or issue. Besides that, the system provides, amongst other, a reminder function.

* Project Management: With this module we manage internal projects as well as client projects. The system provides us, amongst other, with automatically generated Gantt Charts, timelines, project lists and time reports.

 
What is still missing is email integration (Outlook and Thunderbird) as well as an offer/billing module. Therefore, at this stage we do not consider Semantic MediaWiki as a full CRM replacement but rather as a very interesting perspective that has the potential to grow into a serious CRM solution in the future.

The [http://migadv.com Miga Data Viewer], or Miga for short, is a lightweight JavaScript framework for displaying and browsing structured data that's stored in CSV files, that I released in July 2013. It does not directly use or interact with Semantic MediaWiki, but it has a number of important connections to SMW:
* It was inspired by the generic approach to data structures pioneered (or at least popularized) by SMW.
* Its approach to data storage borrows heavily from SMW, including storing data as triples, and a similar set of data types (Text, Number, etc.).
* Its browsing interface borrows heavily from the [[Semantic Drilldown]] extension.
* It includes some &quot;importer&quot; scripts for creating CSV files from various data sources, including one for SMW (the other two are for MediaWiki and Wikidata).
* It can function as a mobile-friendly interface (with offline capability) for viewing the data from an SMW wiki.

Additionally, the &quot;smart&quot; approach to data browsing that Miga takes suggests possibilities for improvement of the SMW ecosystem. It has already led to one major change: in Semantic Drilldown, as of version 1.3, filter values are generated automatically, based on the data layout; they are no longer defined manually. There are other potential improvements that could be made:
* Perhaps there should be maps automatically generated for pages with coordinate properties.
* Perhaps there should be calendars/timelines automatically generated for pages with date properties.
* Perhaps every category should have a table showing all its data automatically generated.
* Perhaps every property should automatically display a distribution graph of its values.

It's possible that the Semantic Drilldown extension should be the interface for all these automatic visualizations - essentially replicating the Miga interface to the greatest extent possible. That's a matter of opinion, and potentially there will be an opportunity to discuss this during the talk.</text>

The Semantic Forms extension has been around for six years, but it's still growing and evolving. Some interesting features that have been added recently, or that are expected to be added by the time of SMWCon, include:
* a &quot;section&quot; tag for form definitions
* an &quot;add instance above&quot; button for multiple-instance templates
* native handling for the &quot;Category&quot; and &quot;Categories&quot; input types (no longer relying on the CategoryTree extension, and no longer a hack)
* testing scripts for the code.

Of these, the most notable is the &quot;section&quot; tag, which also involved adding section-handling to the Page Schemas extension; this work was done as a Google Summer of Code project by Himeshi De Silva.

We'll go over some of these, and then go over other potential additions and changes to the extension (such as support for the VisualEditor and Scribunto extensions), plus your thoughts on what else would be helpful.</text>

We have developed an application called Wikipedia Live Monitor that monitors article edits on different language versions of Wikipedia — as they happen in realtime.

Wikipedia articles in different languages are highly interlinked. For example, the English article “en:2013_Russian_meteor_event” on the topic of the February 15 meteoroid that exploded over the region of Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia, is interlinked with “ru:Падение_метеорита_на_Урале_в_2013_году”, the Russian article on the same topic. As we monitor multiple language versions of Wikipedia and additionally Wikidata in parallel, we can exploit this fact to detect concurrent edit spikes of Wikipedia articles covering the same topics, both in only one, and in different languages or Wikidata fact sheets. We treat such concurrent edit spikes as signals for potential breaking news events, whose plausibility we then check with full-text cross-language searches on multiple social networks. Unlike the reverse approach of monitoring social networks first, and potentially checking
plausibility on Wikipedia second, the approach proposed in our paper has the advantage of being less prone to false-positive alerts, while being equally sensitive to true-positive
events, however, at only a fraction of the processing cost.

A live demo of our application is available online at the URL http://wikipedia-irc.herokuapp.com/, the source code is available under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license at https://github.com/tomayac/wikipedia-irc. In this talk, we mainly focus on the integration of Wikidata into the monitoring loop.

In this talk, we will report on our work of incorporating Wikidata in our tool [https://wikipedia-irc.herokuapp.com/ Wikipedia Live Monitor].</text>

During Wikimania 2013 in Hong Kong, I had a chance to talk in person with several users of MediaWiki and Semantic MediaWiki.  A common theme emerged: cumbersome upgrades and a lack of dependency management.  We're going to be working on these issues.

I'll talk about the projects that need to be done, what you can expect and how you can get involved.

* Current situation
** Upgrading MediaWiki is easy, upgrading extensions is not
** Hard to find working extension versions for older MW releases
** Becomes even more apparent with LTS version

* Development for different versions
** Compatibility layer / mulitple supported MediaWikis
*** Doesn't solve the actual problem
** Tagging in git
*** How it works
*** Problem: backporting of security and bugfixes for older versions
** Branching in git
*** Currently not supported

* Managing dependencies
** Require minimum version
** How do we define a maximum version
** How about several dependencies, e.g. Stub

* Crowd certification
** different paradigm: show what works instead of excluding things that don't work
** On mediawiki.org, everyone can indicate working combinations
** WikiApiary can also be a good indicator

* Discussion</text>

With 3 large neuroscience projects kicking off in the next couple of months one of the question people has asked is how will we be able to integrate existing data and knowledge on a global level in neuroscience. I will present DataSpace/LabSpace/KnowledgeSpace a tool that we developed to address this problem. One of the components of this system is SemanticMediaWiki which makes it easy for experimenters to &quot;see&quot; their data, while allowing modelers to access the same data on a much larger scale for modeling of neurocircuitry. The flexibility of the wiki platform allows experimenters, data analysts and modelers to continual refine our understanding about elements of the neural system in a global collaborative way.
Hi,

Since it's start in 2005 the BlueBrainProject has tried to build realistic models of human neuronal networks by setting up a modelling workflow that allows the easy integration of novel lab data. The workflows have been developed on a data set that was experimentally obtained in an electrophysiological laboratory during a period of some 15-20 years. The vast majority of data was obtained under virtually identical experimental conditions (same animal age, sex, processing protocol, stimulation protocol...). Thanks to the refinement of the workflow over time and the increase of computational power of the hardware used to build and simulate in-silico circuits the BlueBrainProject can today build biological realistic models with thousands of neurone, replicating a wide range of structural and physiological properties that are consistent with biologically tissue properties. 

We have started to use SemanticMedia Wiki technology to keep an inventory of meta data of experimental protocols, data artefacts generated and analysis performed on them. The wiki provides links to raw data, analysis artefacts, and models stored in a distributed file system, called dataspace. On top of this it is also a place where information extracted from the literature, by a uima natural language processing engine, is accessible to researchers to drive the topical data integration process using information streams derived from data, models and literature.

In this tutorial we'll go through the process of creating collaborative enterprise knowledge base. We will go step by step from considering the general model of the knowledge management process to implement the enterprise case base as example. 

Areas of consideration include: 
* Abstract model of knowledge management 
* Aspects of motivation of participants 
* Planning and implementation stages of the project 
* The life cycle of a knowledge base 
* An example of a knowledge base in progress, from enterprise case memory to adaptive case management.

Half the time we are given to the analysis and planning of the implementation of the knowledge base, the other half - immediately implementation. Thus, we are planning a some discussion on the topic of collaborative knowledge bases and description of practices, as well as the creation of forms and queries in the Semantic MediaWiki.

This tutorial may be interesting to both developers and implementers MediaWiki, as well as project managers and specialists in the field of knowledge management and adaptive case management.</text>

Small companies can benefit much from information systems that are tailor made and simple to use. With SMW it is possible to create such systems that are also affordable.

Such wiki's support CRM, sales management, calculations and proposals, invoicing, projects and sometimes tasks that are specific for the customer. The result is always tailor made: the system perfectly reflects the processes and terminology of the customer.

In this talk characteristics, best practices and opportunities of such working environments for small companies will be discussed. This will be illustrated with some 'live' demo's.</text>

Although scientists in many disciplines share data through community repositories so that others can harvest those data for analysis and publications (e.g., in astronomy, physics, etc), this paradigm has failed in other scientific disciplines. In some cases, scientists prefer to define themselves the metadata that they want to specify, rather than being required to provide what is pre-defined as required by the repository. In other cases, the data collectors have no incentives to invest the effort required to formally and fully describe their datasets. At the heart of this problem is the traditional treatment of data sharing as a separate function in science, where data repositories are not integrated with the practices of science. We are investigating the use of semantic wikis as a platform for scientific communities to create and converge organically on metadata properties that suit their needs. We are also investigating &quot;organic data science&quot; as a paradigm to support data sharing as a collective activity that is integrated with other activities in scientific research, such as the joint formulation of shared science questions and their pursuit through shared workflows for data analysis. This approach is consistent with recent trends to make scientific software and data more open and broadly accessible across disciplines, as well as open to volunteer contributors and to citizen scientists. A key aspect of this work is the credit to contributors through provenance and the development of proactive mechanisms to encourage structure and convergence. Our organic data science approach can benefit other Semantic MediaWiki projects for social knowledge collection, particularly those focusing on big data integration and analysis.

This talk describes joint work with Paul Hanson from the Center for Limnology at the University of Wisconsin Madison and Chris Duffy from the Department of Civil Engineering at Pennsylvania State University.</text>

There are hundreds of communities that are using semantic wikis for social knowledge collection. Although wikis have been analyzed extensively, there has been little analysis of the behaviors of semantic wiki communities. We analyzed 230 installations of Semantic MediaWiki, focusing on how users edit wikis to add structure to their contents. We analyzed the concepts and properties created, the amount of editors involved in creating them, and the amount of edits for concepts and for properties. We found that concepts are not used very often, and not used at all in many wikis. Properties were used in all the wikis, although very small numbers of users edit them. Very large numbers of property assertions are made in almost every wiki. Our analysis contributes to the understanding of semantic wikis as a platform for social knowledge collection, and suggests extensions to semantic wikis that proactively prompt users to define concepts or properties, detect inconsistent definitions, and mediate their resolution. Improving the ability of all users to contribute to the semantic aspects of the wiki will enhance the use of knowledge-rich systems and broaden the adoption of semantic web technologies.

Semantic MediaWiki is a natural fit for many knowledge management needs. It enables communities to collaborate on a growing and evolving body of knowledge. This is a Good Thing, but at the same time poses some interesting questions - especially in an enterprise setting. Many organizations have quite strict procedures for approving certain 'versions' of the body of knowledge. In our architecture consultancy, for instance, we frequently encounter the situation that an architecture board formally and periodically determines the contents of a new version of the architecture. Even though there are several extensions (such as ApprovedRevs and FlaggedRevs, Semantic History or Semantic Watchlist) that support this kind of approval cycle to a certain extent, this support only goes so far. 

There is an interesting analogy to be drawn with the way code development works. Here, too, we see communities (of developers) that contribute to a shared body of knowledge (the code base). And unlike the knowledge management community, the coding community has several proven tools to manage the release of new versions. Most serious development efforts are supported by version control systems such as Git, Subversion and CVS. When a new version of the software is released, the code is 'tagged' so that the state of the code base at the time of release can always be reproduced. The code base can also be 'branched out' to maintain earlier releases or to try out new ideas without disturbing progress of the main development. This is what we need for knowledge too! 

In this talk, I would like to explore with the audience the possibilities to 'travel through time' in Semantic MediaWiki, borrowing concepts and ideas from version control systems. What does it mean to 'tag' and 'branch' knowledge? What are the use cases? And what would it take to implement this in SMW?</text>

|Title=SmartCore™ – Managing SMW content structure for dummies

SMW enables you to structure the content of your wiki by using forms and templates. However, creating and maintaining these is cumbersome since wiki code is not very user friendly. SmartCore™ enables you to manage your content structure (classes, properties and relations) as if it were plain content itself – and in fact it is plain content! Changes (such as adding a property) can be made on the fly and will be reflected immediately in forms and content pages. To use SmartCore™ you don’t need programming any wiki code. No pipes, no curly braces, etc. And since the SmartCore™ code itself consists of wiki content, it is fully configurable without any php programming.

Apart from being a useful enhancement to SMW, the Smartcore project is an interesting example of using (and even stretching) the nearly unlimited possibilities of SMW.

Topics treated:
* Architecture of SmartCore™&lt;br/&gt;Smartcore consists of a set of predefined SMW templates, forms and properties which are used to define the content structure of a wiki (i.e. to define classes, properties and relations). In addition, smartcore provides a dynamic semantic form and template for creating the actual end-user wiki content in accordance with the self-defined content structure. Furthermore, smartcore provides some additional templates for a.o. automatically showing content classes in the sidebar.
* Interesting details&lt;br/&gt;To make smartcore work, we have had to overcome some specific difficulties in SMW such as how to make semantic forms truly dynamic. I'd like to share these with the audience and get response. You might call this 'lessons learned'.
* Walkthrough&lt;br/&gt;I'll show how smartcore works in real life by defining a new content structure and creating some content. I will also show dynamically changing the content strcture.
* Real-life example&lt;br/&gt;I will show a real life example of an operational wiki using Smartcore for dynamic content structure management.
* Future of content structure management&lt;br/&gt;Conceptually, Smartcore is a workaround for not having a perfect solution for content structure management. So finally I would like to share and discuss some thoughts on how content structures would best be defined and managed using standards such as RDF/OWL. I also want to ask if there would be any interest in having Smartcore available as open source.</text>

[[mws:Extension:LightweightRDFa|LightweightRDFa]] is a &quot;lightweight&quot; extension that enables simple wiki markup annotation (compatible with SMW syntax) with a simple RDFa output, that could be the first step towards a more advanced SMW setup.
The RDFa output is simple using the page's url and every property is under the website's namespace. Metadata parsing is meant to be provided by external tools such as RDFa parsers or the [http://dbpedia.org DBpedia framework]. To make it more appealing for an end (non-technical) user the annotation is shown as a link tooltip.

Technically, the Lightweight part comes from the fact that only 3 hooks are used in this extension: LinkBegin, OutputPageBodyAttributes &amp; BeforePageDisplay. We hook In LinkBegin to provide the link annotation extension and the other two hooks provide basic namespaces and an &quot;about&quot; attribute in the &lt;body&gt; element.

This could also fit in the Lightning talk session but could also take a little more that 4 minutes.</text>

This talk covers the experience of [http://www.hallowelt.biz Hallo Welt!] developers and decision makers, gathered in a real world project: Creating a ''Software Feature Matrix'' for the [http://www.blueforge.biz BlueForge] website. We want to explain the idea behind the project, share the evaluation process and report about pitfalls and problems.

==What is BlueForge? What is a Software Feature Matrix?==
* Software directory
* Stakeholder
** User / enthusiast
** Decision makers
** Vendors
** Consultants
* Not: End user in need for a manual

==Requirements / Evaluation / Selection==
* Specifics of software features
** there are variants (e.g. &quot;free&quot; vs. &quot;professional version&quot;) / forks
** there are versions with new features or different implementations of the same feature
** features are not binary, they differ in quality
* Feature comparison
* There are groups / cateories of software
* Features can be added / evaluated within the wiki/wikidata via UI
* State of knowledge (Wikidata) vs. actual knowledge (SMW)

==Proposed data model==
Within Wiki
* An article represents a piece of software, all versions, all variants
* A category represents a group of software. A piece of software can be in multiple categories

===Structured data===
* A piece of software is an item
* A feature is a property
** features have qualifiers (since version, user rating, ...)
** features have sources (vendor, user)
** features have (custom) data types
* Groups are an item
* Features of a group are a property of property (aka schema)
* Naming is consistent between wiki and wikidata -&gt; link is by convention

===Server setup===
* there are two systems: Wiki and (local instance of) Wikidata

==Experience with Wikidata==
* Data model can be implemented in Wikidata. Philosopy seems to overlap
* Architecture seems to be flexible enough
* Officially not ready for 3rd party use: we are '''very early adopters :)'''
* Schema via UI / tool support
* Hard to set up, we used vagrant in the end (?)
* PHP dependency: do not use &gt; 5.3.6 (? have to look that up)
* Value autocomplete seems to be resource intensive without additional data stores</text>

==Program==
14:30 - 15:00: Introductory talk
*Introduction to architectural knowledge and architectural knowledge management
*How to manage architectural knowledge in SMW
*Using ArchiMate metamodel for enterprise architecture
*Real-life use cases from Dutch-government and ArchiXL’s architecture practice

15:30 - 18:00: Hands-on implementing a knowledge model
*Defining a knowledge model on IT Application’s and IT infrastructure based upon ArchiMate or UML
*We will a model with about 10 concepts and relations.
*Divide the model over 3 or 4 groups, depends on number of people in audience
*They model the concepts and relations in Page Schema’s in a wiki (with support of Yuri et al)
*We show the result of one possible solution in another wiki
*We define some questions we want to ask the model
*We give the questions to the attendees to formulate their own queries

==The Case==
An organisation wants to have an application landscape map. The ArchiMate Core object types for such a landscape are 
#Application Services (functionality) 
#Application Components (applications)
#System Software (OS, database)
#Devices (hardware)
#Architecture principles
#Architecture guidelines

Architecture is about principles and guidelines for the application landscape, e.g. &quot;''The choice for our database is always MySQL''&quot;, this could be a guideline/requirement/constraint. ANother exampl is: &quot;''We want to standardize our database management software.''&quot; So these are statements which are mapped on the ArchiMate Motivation Extension

==The assignment==
*Make a model in UML (on paper) - 30 minutes
**In our case we want to make a model which combines the object types names above, relations included. We make use of a small subset the ArchiMate language.
**We also have to define attributes for these objects.
**We will add relations between concepts
*Enter the model in Page Schema’s (under the guidance of Yuri)  - 20 minutes
*Set up some queries, by using Special:Ask e.g. 
**What is the impact on changing a architecture guideline or principle
**Overview of application components and application services
**The same for system software and devices
**Use different output types
**The use of inline queries</text>

__NOTOC__

'''In this talk, I would like to show, how Business Process Modeling (BPM) could benefit from semantic technologies through the use of  Semantic MediaWiki. gesinn.it successfully implemented numerous Semantic MediaWiki powered BPM projects since 2011. I'd like to share some insights with the community and enterprise users.'''

The term &quot;business process modeling&quot; was coined in the 1960s by S. Williams in his 1967 article &quot;Business Process Modeling Improves Administrative Control&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;Williams, S. (1967); &quot;Business Process Modeling Improves Administrative Control,&quot; In: ''Automation''. December, 1967, pp. 44 - 50.&lt;/ref&gt; His idea was that techniques for obtaining a better understanding of physical control systems could be used in a similar way for business processes.

In the 1990s, the term &quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process process]&quot; became a new productivity paradigm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rol95&quot;&gt;Asbjørn Rolstadås (1995); &quot;Business process modeling and reengineering&quot;. in: ''Performance Management: A Business Process Benchmarking Approach''. p. 148-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Companies were encouraged to think in ''processes'' instead of ''functions'' and ''procedures''. Software tools promised to support modeling with modeling notations like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_process_chain Event-driven Process Chain (EPC)] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BPMN Business Process Model and Notation]. Process modeling became more and more a highly specialized issue, leaving those, affected by the processes, behind.

Since the late 2000s, the idea of &quot;Process Management 2.0&quot; is beginning to gain credence.&lt;ref&gt;Kock, Jan-Henning et. al (2011); &quot;Prozessmanagement 2.0&quot;. http://www.detecon-dmr.com/de/article/prozessmanagement-20_2011_04_20/page/1&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to help employees, customers and suppliers collaborate, share, and organize business processes via Web 2.0 technologies. The terms ''Collaborative BPM'', ''Social BPM'' and ''Agile BPM'' has been discussed for a while and BPM tools morphed into BPM 2.0 tools.

But the story continues with &quot;Process Management 3.0&quot; powered by Semantic MediaWiki:
; Time Savings
* in gathering of information through automated information update and aggregation
* in information sharing through automated notification and self-service
* in modeling processes through automated creation of charts
* in maintaining process models through automated update of linked content
* in finding information through semantic search and filtering 

; Improved Communication
* in collaborating on processes through a browser-based architecture
* in exchanging opinions through integrated discussion pages
* in teaching employees through task-related, filterable process models 

; Better Results, Less Mistakes
* in documentation of process models through linked, automatically updated content
* in handling of business transactions through informed employees

* This talk has been given at SMWCon 2010 [http://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/SMWCon_Fall_2010]
* [[Benedikt Kämpgen]], Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods (AIFB), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology
* Talk has partly been supported by ACTIVE Project [http://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/Active/en].
* Slides: [[File:Talk-SMWCon-2010-amsterdam-system-testing-selenium-kaempgen-benedikt.pdf]]
* More information at [[SMW System Testing with Selenium]].

==Q&amp;A==
* Michael Carioso: after every commit, nightly, when? 
** Depends on the Selenium Framework of WMF.
* Karima Rafes: how to check exported RDF? 
** BK: Testing RDF functionality should be possible using Selenium Tests as with PHP, all read/write functionalities of PHP are possible.
* Michael Erdmann: nightly build on server without browser possible, without GUI? 
** BK: No, computer running selenium-server.jar for being remote controlled needs GUI/Windowmanager and Browsers. Tested SMW can be located on another server. Also, the tests can be started from another server.

== Audience ==

This workshop is targeted to users with enough MediaWiki/Semantic MediaWiki experience and/or MediaWiki administration skills that would like to delve into MediaWiki programming and start having some custom hacks in their wikis. 

== Prerequisites ==

* Knowledge of PHP or similar programming languages. 
* You must be able to set up an apache+php+mysql environment.
* It's good to attend our morning session on MW programming since we will refer to its content during the hands-on. 

=== Setting up the environment ===

* For [[SMWCon Fall 2013/Hands-on session. Programming MediaWiki extension/Linux setup|Linux]], [[SMWCon Fall 2013/Hands-on session. Programming MediaWiki extension/Mac setup|Mac OS X]], [[SMWCon Fall 2013/Hands-on session. Programming MediaWiki extension/Windows setup|Windows]]

== Process ==

* During the first minutes we will create live one extension from what we learned in previous sessions and participants will replicate/code it on their own computers. 
* Afterwards, participants will be presented some MediaWiki extension challenges or they could even propose their own. They will have the rest of the session for designing and creating their own prototype extensions. At the end of the session, they will present what they managed to do to the rest of the class.

Teachers will be supporting participants as they develop their extensions.</text>

Wikidata is a project close to Semantic MediaWiki in many ways. Wikidata is live for 1 year now and a lot has been achieved. Wikibase, the software powering Wikidata has been written. A great community has formed around it. Wikidata is being filled with data. Wikipedia and others are starting to use it. We'll be taking a look at what Wikidata has achieved since its start, what we learned during this time and where it is going now. We'll also be demoing some of the tools developed by the community around Wikidata.</text>

[http://dbpedia.org DBpedia] is a crowd-sourced community effort to extract structured information from Wikipedia and make this information available on the Web. DBpedia allows you to ask sophisticated queries against Wikipedia, and to link the different data sets on the Web to Wikipedia data. We hope that DBpedia will make it easier for the huge amount of information in Wikipedia to be used in some new interesting ways. Furthermore, it might inspire new mechanisms for navigating, linking, and improving the encyclopedia itself.

With [http://mappings.dbpedia.org/ DBpedia Mappings Wiki] people can help enhance the information in [http://dbpedia.org DBpedia]. The DBpedia Extraction Framework uses the mappings defined here to homogenize information extracted from Wikipedia before generating structured information in RDF.

Anybody can help by editing the [http://mappings.dbpedia.org/index.php/How_to_edit_the_DBpedia_Ontology DBpedia ontology schema] (classes, properties, datatypes) and the DBpedia [http://mappings.dbpedia.org/index.php/How_to_edit_DBpedia_Mappings infobox-to-ontology mappings]. 

Mappings can be written for a variety of languages, connecting multiligual information to a language-independent unified ontology schema (language-specific labels can be provided there).</text>

This technical workshop is aimed at those who want to get started with Semantic MediaWiki development, and at those who want to improve their skills. For those that want to participate fully, understanding of basic software development principles and the ability to write simple PHP code is required. You will also already need to have a working MediaWiki development environment set up. You can attend the [[SMWCon Fall 2013/Hands-on session. Programming MediaWiki extension|Creating MediaWiki extensions]] workshop earlier during the day if you need help with this. Attention will be paid to workflow, including how to write [[tests]] and how to submit code via [[gerrit]].

There will be ample time for questions.

; Workshop contents

We will be creating a simple [[result format]] that displays analytics baded on event data from the SMW wiki. The result format will reside in its own extension. Attendees will be able to clone a git repo that already contains the foundations of this extension, so they can get right to the interesting parts. A full solution will also be provided, for those who get stuck, or wish to just look at the code rather then writing it themselves.</text>

The wish for clean and ecologically sustainable energy lead to a stronger focus on renewable energy systems. Besides wind and solar power, the  energy turnaround raises questions about an increased usage of water power as an energy source. In Germany, the unused potential is considered to be highest in the regions of Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria. Due to ecological and various other constraints for building power plants within the river basin, it is discussed controversially.

The catchment area of the Kocher in Baden-Württemberg was chosen as an exemplary subject for the hydrological and water management analysis. Semantic MediaWiki served as extensible tool for merging different data sources, calculating and presentation.

The first step covered the modelling and integration of the hydrological data provided as shape files, csv and other formats into a rdf triplestore, which SMW was connected to.

The second task was to query the data within the wiki and to apply the necessary calculations of the hydrological model. For this end scribunto has been extended and used besides it designate role as an improvement for templates.

Finally the results were illustrated together with the geographical data within the wiki. In a further step, the integration of open data from other sources was evaluated.</text>

|Title=OWL Wiki Forms (OWF): A Style Language that Generates Wikis from Semantic Web Ontologies

We describe [http://is.cs.ou.nl/OWF/ OWL Wiki Forms (OWF)], a Semantic MediaWiki extensions that maps any Semantic Web ontologies to a Semantic Forms-based semantic wiki. This enables quick start-up of semantic wikis for given knowledge domains. OWF's initial input is a list of URIs for online files containing Semantic Web ontologies, which are structural models for data on the Semantic Web. The resulting wikis export data entered in their forms-based interface in the semantic Web format RDF. This RDF export conforms to the input ontologies by using their URIs.

OWF builds upon Semantic MediaWiki and Semantic Forms. It provides a special page on which the user enters URI's to Semantic Web ontology files online.  OWF then analyses the structure of these ontologies to automatically generate new pages with which end users can annotate and then browse data conforming to these ontologies.  The types of pages it generates are category, template, property and form pages, relying primarily on Semantic Forms. Any subsequent RDF export from the wiki, including via a SPARQL endpoint for the wiki, uses the URI's of the input ontologies.

To tailor beyond this domain-specific default interface, OWF takes a layer style specification approach similar to that of CSS.  We implement this layering in the Semantic Web style format [http://www.w3.org/2005/04/fresnel-info/ Fresnel], which defines browsing interfaces to Semantic Web data. OWF's implementation of Fresnel is comparable to [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Page_Schemas Page Schemas]. Both Fresnel and Page Schemas provide declarative definitions in standardized syntaxes of Semantic Forms interfaces for given data models.  While Page Schemas uses XML to define Semantic Forms interfaces directly, Fresnel uses RDF to define general semantic browser interfaces, from which OWF generates Semantic Forms code.

OWF extends these two approaches with default and layered style sheets for Fresnel. Our technique automatically generates from any given ontologies Fresnel code that defines a default target interface for data using those ontologies, similar to Page Schemas' generation of interface specifications from database schemas. Hand-written Fresnel code can then cascade over this default interface style to let the user fine-tune it, similar to the layered approach in CSS. Our approach processes the source ontologies and the default and fine-tuning Fresnel to generate an assistive browse-and-annotate wiki interface. The result is the quick initialization and facilitated maintenance of distributed and accessible interfaces for collaborative input of data on the Semantic Web.</text>

In the [http://www.cognitionguidedsurgery.de/index.php?id=2&amp;L=1 Cognition-guided Surgery project] we help medical practitioners to annotate liver patient data using Semantic MediaWiki (Surgipedia). Source data are an continuously extended Excel-sheet as well as paper-based patient folders. In first experiments, we tried to extract semantics (e.g., sub-property-relationships) from the Excel-sheet and to automatically create properties, templates and forms using bots. However, there were several challenges (for instance, practitioners would not like to have templates and forms visually diverge from the original Excel-sheet; forms were too large; extracted semantics were not stable etc.) so that eventually we decided for a more practical approach: We added wikitext to the original Excel-sheet in Excel in an pre-processing step, we exported the Excel-sheet to HTML and copy-pasted the HTML to wiki forms and templates. In this talk, we also describe future challenges on which the presented approach has to be assessed.</text>

[http://nycpedia.com NYCpedia] is the SMW-based knowledgebase component of the pediacities platform.  It collates NYC-related data from disparate data sources.  
It aims to take Open Data from disconnected datasets sitting in various open data catalogs to actionable hyperlocal knowledge.

With Open Data gaining traction around the world, a lot of raw datasets are being released with open licenses by governments.  However, this data is largely 3-star quality at best, in [http://5stardata.info/ Sir Tim Berners-Lee's 5-star Open Data scale] further contributing to the disconnected data silo phenomenon as data portals are largely used as extended FTP servers.  And with governments dealing with large, legacy IT investments, upgrading the data to 5-star Linked Data won't be easily achievable as publishing the data in its current format is already a heavy lift for governments.

Also, 5-star data may not be enough as even [http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html TBL himself concedes].  Metadata is often incomplete or missing altogether.

In this talk, I'll go over the state of Open Data and its challenges, our solution, pediacities' architecture and demo the platform.</text>

In contrast to other approaches, Gridpedia was designed (restricted) to (1) focus on simple RDFS ontology elements, and (2) to provide easy mechanism for interlinking with other schema, e.g., CIM, DBpedia, and &quot;Open Energy Information&quot;.</text>

At KNMI, metadata of observations from the KNMI sensor network is stored in several information systems that are only loosely linked. The collection of provenance metadata by scientists is therefore time-consuming and poses a risk to correct interpretation of observations.  Also engineers and inspectors maintaining the network need to access many systems for information and have to keep the (duplicated) information consistent. This can be laborious and poses a risk to data integrity of sensor network information. To provide better access to metadata for provenance of observations and to manage this metadata more effectively, the need for a collaborative metadata management system has been expressed.  To meet this need, a project has been started and have selected Semantic Mediawiki (SWM)as platform to establish a collaborative metadata management system at KNMI. At the SWMCon, I will present the steps taken and lessons learned towards this SMW based metadata management for sensor networks at KNMI.</text>

|Title=Revolutionizing page naming with semantic properties
|Description=Quite often, we find it helpful to have the actual name of a page from the perspective of MediaWiki to be an automatically-generated static page id, while allowing a semantic property to indicate a name that would be meaningful to a user. This creates complications, including how to select a page in a field of a semantic form. To support this alternative approach to page naming, we have used a modified version of the SemanticTitle extension as well as several extensions to SemanticForms that we have custom developed and are in the process of submitting to the open source community.

The MITRE Gestalt Framework (MGF) comprises a set of extensions and patterns of use for construction of ''web-based social semantic knowledge applications'' that complement the MediaWiki and Semantic MediaWiki software. Out of the box, that MediaWiki and Semantic MediaWiki software provide a blank sheet of paper for capturing enterprise knowledge. Additional extensions and patterns of use are necessary to add structure to that knowledge and promote findability. Our customer environments do not have the millions of editors that contribute to and support Wikipedia. Therefore, there needs to be enough structure in place to help get the wiki content to a critical mass in order to foster contribution. Using the MGF, we have constructed dozens of semantic wikis with varying levels of success and adoption. Through this process, we have learned numerous lessons on how to build and encourage the acceptance of semantic wikis.

One of the problems that we encounter repeatedly in the type of semantic wikis that we develop is the question of how to name wiki pages. Sometimes there is no simple, meaningful way  for a user to create a page name, and sometimes there is a need to allow special characters in a page name or to allow the name of a page to change easily over time. Quite often, we find it helpful to have the actual name of a page from the perspective of MediaWiki to be an automatically-generated static page id, while allowing a semantic property to indicate a name that would be meaningful to a user. This creates complications, including how to select a page in a field of a semantic form. To support this alternative approach to page naming, we have used a modified version of the SemanticTitle extension as well as several extensions to SemanticForms that we have custom developed and are in the process of submitting to the open source community. There are still a couple of open issues, but this approach has already greatly simplified page creation for our customers.

In this talk, we will describe the advantages and disadvantages of this alternative approach to page naming. We will introduce the extensions that we use to support this style. We will give examples, including live demonstrations of several wikis using this approach. And, finally, we will discuss and solicit feedback on open issues.</text>

The MITRE Gestalt Framework (MGF) is a set of extensions and design patterns based on MediaWiki and Semantic MediaWiki used to build enterprise semantic encyclopedias. Using the MGF, our team constructed more than 50 semantic encyclopedias with varying levels of success and adoption.  
 
MITRE is a not-for-profit company that operates several federally-funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) which provide systems engineering and advanced technology solutions to government customers. MITRE fosters a culture of knowledge sharing and employees are encouraged to apply what is learned from addressing one customer's challenges to similar issues faced by other customers. 

Our team began using Semantic MediaWiki in 2006 when we were asked to summarize MITRE activities related to one of our capability areas – human language technology (HLT). We recognized the difficulties associated with finding documents across document management systems as well as reusing document information. We chose Semantic MediaWiki to build our first topic-centric encyclopedia about HLT called Languapedia. Once the word was out about the usefulness of organizing information using wikis, we were asked to build semantic encyclopedias for robotics, mobile computing, acquisition, systems engineering, experimentation, radar, and social media. 
 
In this talk, we will give examples including live demonstrations of several wikis that we have developed. We will present lessons learned that contribute to the successful adoption of semantic encyclopedias in a corporate environment. We will discuss our future objectives, including the federation of enterprise encyclopedias as chapters within a corporate semantic encyclopedia.</text>

When employing wikis in small as well as big enterprises, the question about access control arises naturally. Especially in case where specific wiki pages -- or specific property values -- contain sensitive information and should only be readible or editable by a certain user group, different roles need be introduced. For instance, there are several groups focusing on different technologies. While each group should only be able to read and edit wiki pages of their responsibility, the department manager should be able to read and write any wiki page, in addition to some only exclusive pages regarding the assessment of technologies. Based on a concrete use case, this talk will present a state-of-the-art overview of existing extensions of MediaWiki regarding access control on page level and property level. Since an adequate access control mechanism is often not available, the way of proceeding and requirements for the development of such an access control mechanism in a typical industrial setting will be shown.</text>

The objective of this framework is to sustain and encourage the collaboration between different kind of experts for modeling domains and for providing a semantic representation of the it.
Examples of experts are the Domain Experts (i.e. those that knows the domain but usually lacks the modelling skills), and the Knowledge Engineers (those that have the skills but have not a clear understanding of the domain).
During this talk, I will present the last version of MoKi, the wiki-based tool designed for supporting such a framework and I will show how this tool has been customized and extended in several projects in order to face the different challenges raised by the usage of semantic representations in different domains.</text>

This tutorial will provide an overview of some of the most popular and/or useful extensions available to MediaWiki- and Semantic MediaWiki-based sites; for some extensions there may be a hands-on element as well.

Extensions covered include:
[[File:Gardenology-edit-plant.PNG|thumb|left|Screenshot of Semantic Forms]]
* '''[[mw:Extension:Semantic Forms|Semantic Forms]]''' - lets you set up forms to edit template calls that in turn set Semantic MediaWiki properties, helping wikis to look and feel like standard database-backed websites. Each form definition is stored as a wiki page. SF also provides helper functionality to create forms, templates, etc. automatically. It is by far the most popular SMW extension, in use on around 80% of SMW-based wikis. 
* '''[[mw:Extension:Semantic Forms Inputs|Semantic Forms Inputs]]''' - a spinoff extension that defines additional input types for SF, mostly Javascript-based.
* '''[[mw:Extension:Semantic Drilldown|Semantic Drilldown]]''' - provides a drill-down interface for semantic data. Each individual &quot;filter&quot; corresponds to a single semantic property, and each category gets its own drill-down page.
* '''[[mw:Extension:Maps|Maps]]''' &amp; '''[[mw:Extension:Semantic Maps|Semantic Maps]]''' - provide display, and form-based entry, of address and coordinate data using maps.
* '''[[mw:Extension:Semantic Compound Queries|Semantic Compound Queries]]''' - display of multiple queries at once - useful especially for maps and calendars, where different types of pages can be displayed with different icons or colors.
* '''[[mw:Extension:Semantic Watchlist|Semantic Watchlist]]''' - lets users monitor changes to the values of semantic properties, including via email.
* '''[[mw:Extension:Page Schemas|Page Schemas]]''' - lets administrators create and update their wiki's data structures - forms, templates, properties, etc. - by just filling out a form. The schema information is stored as XML on the wiki, which allows for importing a schema from a non-wiki source.
* '''[[mw:Extension:ConfirmEdit|ConfirmEdit]]''' - provides an anti-spam CAPTCHA.
* '''[[mw:Extension:Widgets|Widgets]]''' - allows embedding of raw HTML and JavaScript, for video display and many other uses.
* '''[[mw:Extension:Header Tabs|Header Tabs]]''' - split up pages, or forms, into tabs.
* '''[[mw:Extension:Replace Text|Replace Text]]''' - a global search-and-replace interface.
* '''[[mw:Extension:Approved Revs|Approved Revs]]''' - lets admins mark a certain page revision as the approved one, enabling a more flexible approach to controlling write-access.
* '''[[mw:Extension:External Data|External Data]]''' - lets a wiki display data queried from an outside data source, including web APIs, relational (and NoSQL) databases and LDAP directories.
* '''[[mw:Extension:Data Transfer|Data Transfer]]''' - allows for import and export of structured data (i.e., template calls) via XML or CSV.
* '''[[mw:Extension:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]]''' - a new WYSIWYG editing tool, developed for use on Wikipedia.
* '''[[mw:Extension:Scribunto|Scribunto]]''' - allows for well-scripted logic within pages, using the Lua scripting language.</text>
